      correctOptionIndex: 1,
      explanation: 'In ROSE → TQUG, each letter is shifted forward by 2 positions (+2 in alphabetical order):\n• R (+2) = T\n• O (+2) = Q\n• S (+2) = U\n• E (+2) = G\n\nSimilarly, for LOTUS:\n• L (+2) = N\n• O (+2) = Q\n• T (+2) = V\n• U (+2) = W\n• S (+2) = U\nWait, let us check TULIP: T (+2) = V, U (+2) = W, L (+2) = N, I (+2) = K, P (+2) = R. Correct!\nFor LOTUS:\n• L (+2) = N\n• O (+2) = Q\n• T (+2) = V\n• U (+2) = W\n• S (+2) = U. Thus, "NQWVT" is correct.',

      explanation: 'Let\'s represent these using Euler circles or Venn diagrams:\n• All Gliders (G) are inside Flyers (F).\n• Some Flyers (F) intersect with Birds (B).\n\nAnalysis of Conclusions:\n• Conclusion I ("Some Gliders are Birds") - There is no guaranteed overlap between Gliders (G) and Birds (B). They may or may not intersect. Thus, this is not definitely true.\n• Conclusion II ("Some Birds are Flyers") - Since "Some Flyers are Birds", it naturally follows that "Some Birds are Flyers". This is always true.\nTherefore, only conclusion II follows.',
      concept: 'Syllogisms: Overlapping set relationships and definite vs. possible conclusions.',

      explanation: 'Let\'s place the friends in order around the circle:\n1. Place C and D: C is immediately left of D. (Order clockwise: D, C)\n2. B is between C and E. So, E must be next to B. (Order clockwise: D, C, B, E)\n3. F is between A and E. (Order clockwise: D, C, B, E, F, A)\n\nLet\'s check the circle layout: A, D, C, B, E, F (clockwise).\n• Immediate left of E is B (since they face the center, clockwise movements represent the left side when looking from E\'s perspective).

      options: ['6 days', '7.2 days', '8.4 days', '7.5 days'],
      correctOptionIndex: 1,
      explanation: 'Let\'s find the total work using the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of days:\n• LCM(12, 18) = 36 units (Total Work).\n• Efficiency of A = 36 / 12 = 3 units/day.\n• Efficiency of B = 36 / 18 = 2 units/day.\n• Combined Efficiency = 3 + 2 = 5 units/day.\n\nTime taken together = Total Work / Combined Efficiency = 36 / 5 = 7.2 days.',

      options: ['₹4', '₹5', '₹6', '₹3'],
      correctOptionIndex: 0,
      explanation: 'Let\'s solve using ratios:\n• Price reduction = 20% = 1/5.\n• Price ratio (Original : Reduced) = 5 : 4.\n• Consumption ratio (Original : Reduced) = 4 : 5 (since expenditure ₹100 is constant).\n• Difference in consumption ratio = 5 - 4 = 1 part.\n• 1 part = 5 kg.\n• Reduced consumption = 5 parts × 5 kg = 25 kg.\n• Reduced Price = Total Cost / Reduced Quantity = ₹100 / 25 kg = ₹4 per kg.',
      concept: 'Price, Consumption & Expenditure: Inverse proportionality of price and consumption.',
      shortcut: 'Reduced Price per kg = (Cost × Reduction%) / Extra Quantity = (100 × 20%) / 5 = 20 / 5 = ₹4/kg.',

      options: ['20 seconds', '24 seconds', '32 seconds', '40 seconds'],
      correctOptionIndex: 2,
      explanation: 'Let\'s calculate the speed of the train:\n1. Passing a telegraph post means traveling its own length (150 m).\n• Speed = Distance / Time = 150 / 12 = 12.5 m/s.\n\n2. Crossing a bridge means traveling its own length + bridge length (150 m + 250 m = 400 m).\n• Time taken = Total Distance / Speed = 400 / 12.5 = 32 seconds.',
      concept: 'Time, Speed & Distance: Relative train length motion relative to static point and block barriers.',
      shortcut: 'Distance is proportional to time when speed is constant. Speed is 150m in 12s. To cross the bridge, total distance is 150m + 250m = 400m. Time = 12s × (400 / 150) = 12s × (8 / 3) = 32 seconds.',
      source: 'RRB NTPC 2021',
      difficulty: 'Medium',
      takeaway: 'Always remember: crossing objects with physical length requires adding the train\'s own length to the object\'s length.'

      options: ['16 years', '24 years', '32 years', '20 years'],
      correctOptionIndex: 1,
      explanation: 'Let\'s analyze using simple interest:\n• Sum P becomes 2P in 8 years. Interest earned = 2P - P = P.\n• To become 4P, the sum must earn interest equal to 4P - P = 3P.\n• Simple Interest is linear and constant over equal time periods.\n• If interest P is earned in 8 years, then interest 3P will be earned in: 3 × 8 = 24 years.',
      concept: 'Simple Interest: Constant linear rate growth of principal base.',
      shortcut: 'Use simple interest multiple formula: (N1 - 1) / T1 = (N2 - 1) / T2 → (2 - 1) / 8 = (4 - 1) / T2 → 1/8 = 3/T2 → T2 = 24 years.',
      source: 'SSC CGL 2022 Tier-2',
      difficulty: 'Hard',
      takeaway: 'Simple Interest accumulates on the original principal only, making interest growth strictly linear, unlike Compound Interest which is exponential.'

      correctOptionIndex: 2,
      explanation: 'Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and the highest frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum, carrying the highest energy. Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency and energy (E = hc/λ). The order of electromagnetic waves from longest wavelength (lowest frequency) to shortest wavelength (highest frequency) is: Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared, Visible Light, Ultraviolet, X-rays, Gamma rays.',
      concept: 'Electromagnetic Spectrum: Relationship between frequency, wavelength, and photon energy.',
      shortcut: 'Remember mnemonic: "R-M-IV-U-X-G" (Rich Men In Vegas Use X-ray Goggles). Wavelength decreases left-to-right, so Gamma (G) is shortest/highest energy.',
      source: 'SSC CGL 2023 Tier-1',
      difficulty: 'Easy',
      takeaway: 'Gamma rays are emitted during radioactive decay and nuclear reactions, possessing extreme penetration power.'

      question: 'Which organelle is known as the "Powerhouse of the Cell" and is responsible for synthesizing energy in the form of ATP?',
      options: ['Lysosome', 'Ribosome', 'Mitochondria', 'Golgi Apparatus'],
      correctOptionIndex: 2,
      explanation: 'Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles where cellular respiration occurs, converting nutrients into Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the primary energy currency of biological cells. They contain their own DNA and ribosomes, supporting the endosymbiotic theory of origin.',
      concept: 'Cellular Biology: Organelle functions and bioenergetics.',
      shortcut: 'Mitochondria = ATP energy synthesis. Lysosome = Suicide bag. Ribosome = Protein factory.',
      source: 'Railway Group D 2022',
      difficulty: 'Easy',
      takeaway: 'Mitochondria contain specialized internal folds called cristae that maximize surface area for chemical reactions.'

      question: 'Which acid is primarily present in sour milk and curd, formed as a byproduct of bacterial fermentation of lactose?',
      options: ['Citric Acid', 'Lactic Acid', 'Tartaric Acid', 'Acetic Acid'],
      correctOptionIndex: 1,
      explanation: 'Curd and sour milk contain Lactic Acid. Bacteria called Lactobacillus ferment the lactose sugar present in milk into lactic acid, which coagulates milk proteins (casein) to turn it into curd. This acid gives curd its characteristic sour taste.',
      concept: 'Organic Acids in Daily Life: Fermentation biochemistry.',
      shortcut: 'Lactose / Lacto- = Milk prefix. So Lactose → Lactic Acid. Citric is for lemons, Tartaric for tamarind, Acetic for vinegar.',
      source: 'SSC MTS 2021',
      difficulty: 'Easy',
      takeaway: 'Lactobacillus bacteria are probiotics that are highly beneficial for digestive health.'

      question: 'India\'s historic Chandrayaan-3 lunar mission successfully landed its Vikram lander near which region of the Moon in August 2023?',
      options: ['Equatorial region', 'North Pole', 'South Pole', 'Far Side crater basin'],
      correctOptionIndex: 2,
      explanation: 'ISRO\'s Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully landed its lander module (Vikram) and rover (Pragyan) near the South Pole of the Moon on August 23, 2023. This achievement made India the first country in the world to reach the lunar south polar region, and the fourth country overall to soft-land on the Moon.',
      concept: 'Space Exploration Milestones: Indian lunar programs.',
      shortcut: 'August 23 is now celebrated as National Space Day in India to commemorate this historic landing.',
      source: 'UPSC CSE 2024 / SSC CGL 2023',
      difficulty: 'Easy',
      takeaway: 'The lunar South Pole is highly sought after because of geological indications of extensive water-ice deposits inside permanently shadowed craters.'

      options: ['European Union', 'ASEAN', 'African Union', 'BRICS'],
      correctOptionIndex: 2,
      explanation: 'Under India\'s G20 presidency at the New Delhi Summit in September 2023, the African Union (AU) was admitted as a permanent member of the G20, representing its 55 member states. This is the first expansion of the G20 since its creation in 1999, elevating the voice of the Global South in global governance.',
      concept: 'Multilateral Diplomacy: G20 expansions and geopolitical shifts.',
